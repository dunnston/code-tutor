Excellent! Let me expand Level One into a much more detailed adventure with deeper branching paths and more encounters.

## Level One: The Abandoned Fortress - EXPANDED

**Starting Point: The Crumbling Gate**
You stand before the moss-covered entrance of an ancient fortress. The air smells of decay and old stone. Torch light flickers from within, casting dancing shadows. Three paths lie ahead:

---

**Scene 2: Courtyard Investigation**
Three options present themselves:

### Option A1: Inspect the Ancient Well

    - **Choice**: Descend into the well OR mark it for later
    - **If descend**: → Goes to **Underground Aqueduct** (new area)
  - **Failure**: The well looks too dangerous. You can't tell if the rope would hold
