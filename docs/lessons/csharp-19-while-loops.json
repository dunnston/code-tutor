  "description": "# Looping with Conditions\n\nSometimes you don't know HOW MANY times to loop - you just know WHEN to stop. That's where **while loops** come in!\n\n## While Loop Basics\n\nA while loop repeats as long as a condition is true:\n\n```csharp\nint health = 100;\nint damage = 15;\n\nwhile (health > 0)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Health: {health}\");\n    health -= damage;\n}\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Defeated!\");\n```\n\n**Important:** Make sure your condition eventually becomes false, or you'll have an infinite loop!\n\n## While vs For\n\n**Use for loop when:** You know how many iterations you need\n```csharp\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)  // Exactly 10 times\n```\n\n**Use while loop when:** You loop until a condition changes\n```csharp\nwhile (playerHealth > 0)  // Until player dies\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n```csharp\n// Countdown until threshold\nint gold = 100;\nwhile (gold >= 20)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Buying item for 20 gold. Gold: {gold}\");\n    gold -= 20;\n}\n\n// Level up until max\nint level = 1;\nwhile (level < 10)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Level {level}\");\n    level++;\n}\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\n1. **Healing Simulation**: Start with 50 health, heal 10 each turn until health >= 100\n2. **Resource Gathering**: Gather gold (start at 0, gain 45 each round) until gold >= 200\n3. **Enemy Waves**: Fight 5 waves of enemies, display wave number\n4. **Level Grind**: Start at level 1, gain 1 level each iteration until level 15",
