  "description": "# Making Choices with Else\n\nYou've learned if statements, but what happens when the condition is false? That's where **else** comes in!\n\n## If/Else Structure\n\nThe else block runs when the if condition is false:\n\n```csharp\nint gold = 30;\nint itemCost = 50;\n\nif (gold >= itemCost)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Purchase successful!\");\n    gold = gold - itemCost;\n}\nelse\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Not enough gold!\");\n}\n```\n\nOne of these blocks will ALWAYS run - either if or else.\n\n**Key C# differences from Python:**\n- Conditions must be in parentheses `( )`\n- Code blocks use curly braces `{ }`\n- Statements end with semicolons `;`\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\nC# supports many comparison operators:\n\n```csharp\n==  // Equal to\n!=  // Not equal to\n>   // Greater than\n<   // Less than\n>=  // Greater than or equal to\n<=  // Less than or equal to\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a merchant system that checks if a player can afford an item:\n1. Set player's gold amount\n2. Set item cost\n3. Use if/else to check if player has enough gold\n4. If yes: Print success message and show remaining gold\n5. If no: Print how much more gold is needed",
