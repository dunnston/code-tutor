  "description": "# Counting with Range\n\nYou've learned to loop through lists, but what if you just want to count? That's where the `range()` function shines!\n\n## The range() Function\n\n`range()` generates a sequence of numbers:\n\n```python\n# Count from 0 to 4 (5 numbers total)\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)  # Prints: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n```\n\n## Range with Start and Stop\n\n```python\n# Count from 1 to 5\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(i)  # Prints: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n```\n\n## Range with Step\n\n```python\n# Count by 2s\nfor i in range(0, 11, 2):\n    print(i)  # Prints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n\n# Count backwards\nfor i in range(10, 0, -1):\n    print(i)  # Prints: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a power-up leveling system:\n1. Use range to print levels 1-10\n2. Calculate damage for each level (level * 5)\n3. Use range to create a countdown timer from 5 to 1\n4. Calculate total XP from levels 1-10 (each level gives level * 100 XP)",

    "To count from 1 to 10, use range(1, 11) - the stop value is exclusive",

    "Complete solution:\n\nfor level in range(1, 11):\n    damage = level * 5\n\nfor count in range(5, 0, -1):\n    print(f'{count}...')\n\ntotal_xp = 0\nfor level in range(1, 11):\n    xp = level * 100\n    total_xp = total_xp + xp"
