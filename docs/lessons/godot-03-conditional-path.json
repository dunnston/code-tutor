  "description": "# The Conditional Path: Making Decisions\n\nWelcome back, game developer! Your journey continues to a fork in the road where you must make choices.\n\nIn game programming, we constantly need code to make decisions:\n- If the player has enough coins, allow the purchase\n- If health is below 20, show a danger warning\n- If the door is locked, require a key\n\n## The If Statement\n\nThe `if` statement checks a condition and runs code only if it's true:\n\n```gdscript\nvar health = 15\n\nif health < 20:\n    print(\"Warning: Low health!\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- `if` starts the condition check\n- `health < 20` is the condition (is health less than 20?)\n- **No colon needed** (unlike Python!)\n- **The indented line** runs only if the condition is true\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\nUse these to compare values:\n- `<` less than\n- `>` greater than\n- `<=` less than or equal\n- `>=` greater than or equal\n- `==` equal to (two equals signs!)\n- `!=` not equal to\n\n## The Else Statement\n\nUse `else` to handle what happens when the condition is false:\n\n```gdscript\nvar gold = 100\n\nif gold >= 50:\n    print(\"You can afford the sword!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough gold yet.\")\n```\n\n## Indentation Matters!\n\n⚠️ **Important:** GDScript uses tabs or spaces to know which code belongs to the if/else.\n\nPress `Tab` to indent:\n\n```gdscript\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")      # This runs if true\n    print(\"Welcome!\")   # This also runs if true\nprint(\"Done\")           # This ALWAYS runs (not indented)\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nYou encounter a magical door that requires a password.\n\n1. Create a variable called `password` with the value `\"dragon\"`\n2. Create a variable called `user_input` with the value `\"dragon\"`\n3. Write an if statement:\n   - If `user_input == password`, print: `\"Access granted!\"`\n   - Otherwise (else), print: `\"Access denied!\"`\n\n**Test both paths:** Try changing `user_input` to something else to see the else branch!",
  "starterCode": "# Create your variables\nvar password = \"dragon\"\nvar user_input = \"dragon\"\n\n# Write your if/else statement below\n\n",
  "solutionCode": "# Create your variables\nvar password = \"dragon\"\nvar user_input = \"dragon\"\n\n# Write your if/else statement below\nif user_input == password:\n    print(\"Access granted!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Access denied!\")",
  "hints": [
    "Use two equals signs to check equality: user_input == password",
    "GDScript doesn't need a colon after if/else (unlike Python)",
    "Indent the print statements (press Tab before the print)",
    "The if and else should NOT be indented, but the prints inside them should be",
    "Make sure you use == (comparison) not = (assignment)"
