  "description": "# Conditional Logic in GDScript\n\nGames are full of decisions: *Is the player alive? Did they collect enough coins? Is the enemy in range?*\n\n**Conditional statements** let your code make decisions!\n\n## The if Statement\n\n```gdscript\nvar health = 100\n\nif health > 0:\n    print(\"Player is alive!\")\n```\n\n**Important:** GDScript uses **indentation** (tabs or spaces) to define code blocks, just like Python!\n\n## if/else\n\n```gdscript\nif health > 50:\n    print(\"Healthy!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Low health!\")\n```\n\n## if/elif/else\n\n```gdscript\nif score >= 100:\n    print(\"Gold medal!\")\nelif score >= 50:\n    print(\"Silver medal!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Keep trying!\")\n```\n\n## Comparison Operators\n- `==` equals\n- `!=` not equals\n- `>` greater than\n- `<` less than\n- `>=` greater than or equal\n- `<=` less than or equal\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a treasure checker!\n\n1. Create a variable `gold_coins` with value `75`\n2. Write conditional logic:\n   - If `gold_coins >= 100`: print \"You are rich!\"\n   - Else if `gold_coins >= 50`: print \"You have some treasure!\"\n   - Else: print \"Keep searching for gold!\"",

    "Start by declaring: var gold_coins = 75",
    "Use if/elif/else for multiple conditions",
    "Don't forget the colon : after each condition",
