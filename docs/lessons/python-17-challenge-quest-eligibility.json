  "description": "# Module 2 Challenge!\n\nYou've mastered variables, input, math, if/else, elif, and logical operators. Time to build a complete system!\n\n## The Quest\n\nCreate a **Quest Eligibility Checker** that determines which quests a player can undertake based on their stats.\n\n### Requirements:\n\n1. **Get player information:**\n   - Player level (number)\n   - Has sword? (yes/no input, convert to True/False)\n   - Current health (number)\n\n2. **Check eligibility for three quests:**\n   - **Easy Quest**: level >= 1 (anyone can do it)\n   - **Medium Quest**: level >= 5 AND has sword\n   - **Hard Quest**: level >= 10 AND has sword AND health > 50\n\n3. **Print results:**\n   - List each quest\n   - Show ✓ if eligible or ✗ if not\n   - Explain why they're not eligible (if applicable)\n\n### Example Output:\n```\nEnter your level: 7\nDo you have a sword? (yes/no): yes\nEnter your current health: 45\n\n=== AVAILABLE QUESTS ===\n✓ Easy Quest: Gather herbs\n✓ Medium Quest: Defeat the goblin chief\n✗ Hard Quest: Slay the dragon\n  Reason: Health too low (need 50+, you have 45)\n```\n\n## Success Criteria:\n- ✅ Gets all inputs from user\n- ✅ Converts yes/no to boolean\n- ✅ Uses if/elif/else correctly\n- ✅ Uses logical operators (and)\n- ✅ Shows clear eligibility for each quest\n- ✅ Explains why player isn't eligible",
