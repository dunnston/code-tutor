  "description": "# Your First Challenge!\n\nYou've learned the basics: Console.WriteLine, variables, input, strings, and math. Now it's time to prove your skills by building something from scratch!\n\n## The Quest\n\nCreate a **Character Profile Generator** that:\n\n### Requirements:\n1. Ask the user for their character's name\n2. Ask for their character's age (as a number)\n3. Ask for their starting gold (as a number)\n4. Calculate gold remaining after buying a sword that costs 50 gold\n5. Print a complete character profile showing:\n   - Character name\n   - Age\n   - Starting gold\n   - Gold after purchase\n   - A welcome message\n\n### Example Output:\n```\nEnter your character's name: Aria\nEnter your character's age: 25\nEnter your starting gold: 150\n\n=== CHARACTER PROFILE ===\nName: Aria\nAge: 25 years old\nStarting Gold: 150\nGold after buying sword: 100\nWelcome to the adventure, Aria!\n```\n\n## Success Criteria:\n- ✅ Uses `Console.ReadLine()` to get name, age, and gold\n- ✅ Converts age and gold to numbers with `int.Parse()` or `Convert.ToInt32()`\n- ✅ Performs math operation (subtraction for sword cost)\n- ✅ Uses string interpolation for formatting\n- ✅ Prints all required information\n\n**This is a challenge - you'll get minimal starter code. Plan your approach first!**",
