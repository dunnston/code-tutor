  "description": "# Computing with Numbers\n\nIn your adventures, you'll constantly calculate things: damage dealt, gold earned, experience gained. Python makes math easy!\n\n## Mathematical Operators\n\nPython supports all basic math operations:\n\n```python\n# Addition\ngold = 100 + 50  # 150\n\n# Subtraction\nhealth = 100 - 25  # 75\n\n# Multiplication\ndamage = 10 * 3  # 30\n\n# Division (always gives a decimal)\nprice = 100 / 4  # 25.0\n\n# Integer Division (rounds down)\nitems = 10 // 3  # 3\n\n# Modulus (remainder)\nremainder = 10 % 3  # 1\n\n# Exponentiation (power)\npower = 2 ** 3  # 8 (2 to the power of 3)\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a gold transaction calculator:\n1. Start with 100 gold\n2. Buy a sword for 50 gold\n3. Sell 3 monster pelts for 15 gold each\n4. Calculate and display:\n   - Gold after buying sword\n   - Gold earned from pelts\n   - Final gold amount\n   - How many 20-gold potions you can afford (use integer division)\n   - Gold remaining after buying potions",
