  "description": "# Welcome to Ruby Programming!\n\nYou've discovered **Ruby** - a beautiful language designed for programmer happiness! Ruby is known for its elegant syntax and is used for web development (Rails), automation, and scripting.\n\n## Your First Ruby Statement\n\nIn Ruby, you display text using `puts` (put string):\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\n**Ruby Basics:**\n- Parentheses are optional for method calls\n- Strings can use single `'` or double `\"` quotes\n- Ruby is **dynamically typed** and everything is an object\n- Ruby values **readability** and **expressiveness**\n\n## puts vs print\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Hello\"   # Prints with newline\nprint \"Hello\"  # Prints without newline\np \"Hello\"      # Prints with inspect (shows quotes)\n```\n\n## Ruby Philosophy\n\nRuby follows the principle of **\"Matz is nice, so we are nice\"** (MINASWAN). The creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, designed Ruby to be enjoyable to write.\n\n## Your Quest\n\nWrite a Ruby program that displays:\n\n**Welcome to Ruby!**\n\nThen on a new line:\n\n**Designed for programmer happiness!**\n\n**Note:** Ruby code is known for being almost like reading English!",

  "hints": [
    "Use puts twice - once for each message",
    "Parentheses are optional: puts \"text\" works",
    "Ruby is case-sensitive: use puts (lowercase)",
    "You can use single 'quotes' or double \"quotes\"",
    "Check the exact spelling of the messages"
