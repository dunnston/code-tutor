Learn to read from files to load persistent data!\n\n## Reading Text Files\n\n```python\n# Method 1: Using with (recommended)\nwith open(\"quest_log.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()  # Read entire file\n    print(content)\n\n# File automatically closes after 'with' block\n```\n\n## Reading Line by Line\n\n```python\n# Read all lines into a list\nwith open(\"items.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n    for line in lines:\n        print(line.strip())  # .strip() removes \\n\n\n# Better: iterate directly\nwith open(\"items.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print(line.strip())\n```\n\n## Parsing Data\n\n```python\n# If file contains: \"Sword,100,weapon\"\nwith open(\"inventory.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        name, value, item_type = line.strip().split(\",\")\n        print(f\"{name} is worth {value} gold\")\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a quest log reader:\n1. Read quest data from a file\n2. Parse each quest (format: \"Quest Name,Status,Reward\")\n3. Display completed quests\n4. Calculate total rewards",
