  "description": "# Welcome to the Game Development Realm!\n\nYou've entered the world of **Godot** and discovered GDScript - a powerful language designed specifically for game creation.\n\nJust like in Python, you can display messages to the console, but in GDScript, you're working within the Godot engine!\n\n## The Print Command\n\nIn GDScript, printing works just like Python:\n\n```gdscript\nprint(\"Hello, Game Developer!\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- `print` is a built-in function\n- Parentheses `()` contain what you want to display\n- Quotation marks `\"\"` define text strings\n- GDScript syntax is Python-inspired and friendly!\n\n## Your Quest\n\nWrite a script that prints two messages:\n\n**Welcome to Godot!**\n\nThen on a new line:\n\n**I am ready to make games!**\n\n**Note:** This lesson teaches GDScript basics. To run GDScript code, you need Godot 4.x installed on your system.",
