  "description": "# Variables: Containers for Magic\n\nGreat work, game developer! Now you'll learn about **variables** - magical containers that store values in your game.\n\nThink of variables as labeled boxes that hold different types of data:\n- A box labeled `health` might hold the number `100`\n- A box labeled `player_name` might hold the text `\"Hero\"`\n- A box labeled `has_sword` might hold `true` or `false`\n\n## Creating Variables in GDScript\n\nTo create a variable in GDScript, use the `var` keyword:\n\n```gdscript\nvar player_name = \"Knight\"\nvar health = 100\nvar level = 1\n```\n\n**The pattern:**\n- `var` - tells GDScript you're making a variable\n- Variable name - what you call it\n- `=` - the equals sign means \"store this value\"\n- Value - what to store\n\n## Using Variables\n\nOnce you create a variable, you can use it with print:\n\n```gdscript\nprint(player_name)  # Displays: Knight\nprint(health)       # Displays: 100\n```\n\n## Variable Naming Rules\n\n✅ **Good names:**\n- `player_name` (use underscores for spaces)\n- `max_health`\n- `gold_amount`\n\n❌ **Bad names:**\n- `player name` (no spaces!)\n- `123gold` (can't start with numbers)\n- `max-health` (dashes not allowed)\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a character for your game:\n\n1. Create a variable called `hero_name` with YOUR name (as text in quotes)\n2. Create a variable called `starting_gold` with the value `50`\n3. Create a variable called `quest_active` with the value `true`\n4. Print all three variables on separate lines\n\n**Tip:** In GDScript, use `true` and `false` (lowercase), not `True` and `False`!",

    "Numbers DON'T need quotation marks: 50",
    "Boolean values are 'true' and 'false' (lowercase in GDScript)",
