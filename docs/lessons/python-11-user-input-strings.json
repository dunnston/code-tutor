  "description": "# Listening to the Player\n\nEvery great adventure begins with a question: *\"What is your name, traveler?\"*\n\nSo far, your programs have only spoken. Now you'll learn to **listen** - to get input from users and respond to them personally.\n\n## The input() Spell\n\nThe `input()` function lets you ask questions and store the answers:\n\n```python\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(\"Greetings, \" + name + \"!\")\n```\n\n## String Concatenation\n\nYou can combine strings using the `+` operator:\n\n```python\ngreeting = \"Hello, \" + \"world\" + \"!\"\n```\n\n## F-Strings: The Modern Way\n\nPython's f-strings make it easy to insert variables into text:\n\n```python\nname = \"Aria\"\nlevel = 5\nmessage = f\"Warrior {name} has reached level {level}!\"\n```\n\nThe `f` before the quotes makes it an f-string, and `{variable}` inserts the variable's value.\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a character introduction system:\n1. Ask for the user's character name\n2. Ask for their character's age (as a number)\n3. Create a personalized greeting using an f-string\n4. Print the greeting",
  "starterCode": "# Get user input for character creation\n# Ask for name\ncharacter_name = input(\"Enter your character's name: \")\n\n# Ask for age (you'll need to convert it to a number using int())\nage = ___  # Fix this line\n\n# Create a personalized greeting using an f-string\n# Example: \"Welcome, Aria! You are 25 years old and ready for adventure!\"\ngreeting = ___  # Create your f-string here\n\n# Print the greeting\n___\n",
  "solutionCode": "# Get user input for character creation\ncharacter_name = input(\"Enter your character's name: \")\n\n# Ask for age\nage = int(input(\"Enter your character's age: \"))\n\n# Create a personalized greeting using an f-string\ngreeting = f\"Welcome, {character_name}! You are {age} years old and ready for adventure!\"\n\n# Print the greeting\nprint(greeting)\n",
