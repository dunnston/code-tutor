  "description": "# Loops in GDScript\n\nIn games, you often need to repeat actions: spawn multiple enemies, iterate through inventory items, or update every frame.\n\n**Loops** let you repeat code without writing it over and over!\n\n## The for Loop\n\nPerfect for repeating a specific number of times:\n\n```gdscript\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(\"Wave \", i)\n```\n\nThis prints:\n```\nWave 0\nWave 1\nWave 2\nWave 3\nWave 4\n```\n\n## Looping Through Lists\n\n```gdscript\nvar weapons = [\"Sword\", \"Bow\", \"Staff\"]\n\nfor weapon in weapons:\n    print(weapon)\n```\n\n## The while Loop\n\nRepeats while a condition is true:\n\n```gdscript\nvar health = 100\n\nwhile health > 0:\n    health -= 10\n    print(\"Health:\", health)\n```\n\n**Warning:** Make sure while loops eventually stop, or they'll run forever!\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a countdown timer!\n\n1. Use a `for` loop with `range(5, 0, -1)` to count down from 5 to 1\n2. Print each number\n3. After the loop, print \"Blast off!\"\n\n**Expected output:**\n```\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nBlast off!\n```\n\n**Tip:** `range(start, stop, step)` lets you control the sequence. A negative step counts backwards!",
