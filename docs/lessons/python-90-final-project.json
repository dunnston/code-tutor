  "description": "# The Ultimate Final Project!\n\n🏆 **Build a complete, production-ready MMO game backend** demonstrating ALL advanced concepts!\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### 1. Architecture\n- Multi-file project structure\n- Config management (dev/prod)\n- Logging system\n- Error tracking\n\n### 2. Database Layer\n- SQLite with full schema:\n  - Players, Characters, Inventory, Equipment\n  - Guilds, Guild Members\n  - Quests, Quest Progress\n  - Combat Logs, Achievements\n  - Market/Trading, Transactions\n- Repository pattern\n- Migration system\n- Connection pooling\n\n### 3. Business Logic\n- Character system (multiple classes)\n- Combat system (PvE and PvP)\n- Inventory and equipment\n- Guild system\n- Quest system\n- Market/trading\n- Level progression\n- Event system (observer pattern)\n\n### 4. API Layer (Flask)\n- RESTful API (30+ endpoints)\n- Authentication & authorization\n- Rate limiting\n- Request validation\n- Error handling\n- API versioning (/api/v1/)\n- Swagger documentation\n\n### 5. Async Operations\n- Async database operations\n- Background tasks\n- Async combat resolution\n- Event broadcasting\n\n### 6. Testing\n- Unit tests (80%+ coverage)\n- Integration tests\n- Database tests\n- Performance tests\n- Fixtures and factories\n\n### 7. Design Patterns\n- Singleton (GameManager, ConfigManager)\n- Factory (CharacterFactory, EnemyFactory)\n- Repository (data access)\n- Observer (event system)\n- Strategy (combat abilities)\n- Decorator (abilities, validation)\n\n### 8. Advanced Features\n- Caching (stats, leaderboards)\n- Performance monitoring\n- Admin dashboard API\n- Statistics and analytics\n- Backup/restore system\n\n### 9. DevOps Basics\n- Environment configuration\n- requirements.txt\n- README with setup\n- Docker support (bonus)\n- CI/CD ready structure\n\n### 10. Documentation\n- API documentation\n- Code documentation\n- Architecture docs\n- Database schema docs\n- User guide\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\n- Minimum 2000 lines of production code\n- Minimum 500 lines of test code\n- Handle 50+ concurrent users\n- Response time < 200ms (cached)\n- < 1 second for complex operations\n- Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities\n- Proper error handling throughout\n- Graceful degradation\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. Complete source code\n2. Comprehensive test suite\n3. Database schema and migrations\n4. API documentation\n5. README with setup\n6. Postman collection\n7. Performance benchmarks\n8. Live demo (local server)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n✅ All features implemented\n✅ Tests pass with good coverage\n✅ API is RESTful and documented\n✅ Code is clean and organized\n✅ Database properly normalized\n✅ No security vulnerabilities\n✅ Performance meets requirements\n✅ Proper error handling\n✅ Design patterns used appropriately\n✅ Professional-quality code\n\n## Bonus Features (+500 XP)\n\n- Docker containerization (+200 XP)\n- CI/CD pipeline (+150 XP)\n- >90% test coverage (+100 XP)\n- Admin web interface (+100 XP)\n- WebSocket real-time features (+150 XP)\n- Deployed to production (+200 XP)\n\n*This is your portfolio project. Make it shine!*",
