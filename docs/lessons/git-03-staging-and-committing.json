  "description": "# Creating Snapshots with Commits\n\nIn Git, saving your work is a two-step process:\n1. **Stage** the changes you want to save\n2. **Commit** those changes with a message\n\nThink of it like packing for a trip:\n- **Staging** = Choosing which items to pack in your suitcase\n- **Committing** = Zipping up the suitcase and labeling it\n\n## The Staging Area\n\nGit has a \"staging area\" (also called the \"index\") where you prepare changes before committing them. This lets you:\n- Choose exactly which changes to include in a commit\n- Review what you're about to save\n- Create logical, organized commits\n\n## The `git add` Command\n\nTo stage files, use:\n\n```bash\n# Stage a specific file\ngit add filename.txt\n\n# Stage all files in current directory\ngit add .\n\n# Stage all changes everywhere\ngit add -A\n```\n\n## The `git commit` Command\n\nOnce files are staged, create a commit with:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Your commit message here\"\n```\n\nThe `-m` flag lets you add a message describing what you changed.\n\n### Good Commit Messages\n\n✅ **Good:**\n- \"Add user login feature\"\n- \"Fix bug in password validation\"\n- \"Update README with installation steps\"\n\n❌ **Bad:**\n- \"stuff\"\n- \"changes\"\n- \"asdfasdf\"\n\nCommit messages should be clear and describe WHAT changed and WHY.\n\n## Complete Workflow Example\n\n```bash\n# Check what changed\ngit status\n\n# Stage all changes\ngit add .\n\n# Create a commit with a message\ngit commit -m \"Add homepage layout\"\n\n# Verify the commit was created\ngit status\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nImagine you've created a file called `README.md`. Write the Git commands to:\n\n1. Stage the README.md file\n2. Commit it with the message \"Add project README\"\n\nPut each command on its own line.",
  "starterCode": "# Stage and commit README.md\n# First: git add README.md\n# Second: git commit -m \"Add project README\"\n\n",
