  "description": "# Combining Conditions\n\nSometimes you need to check multiple things at once. Can the player enter the dungeon? They need BOTH a key AND a high enough level. That's where logical operators shine!\n\n## The Three Logical Operators\n\n### AND - Both must be True\n```python\nhas_key = True\nlevel = 10\n\nif has_key and level >= 5:\n    print(\"Welcome to the dungeon!\")\n```\n\n### OR - At least one must be True  \n```python\nif is_admin or is_moderator:\n    print(\"You have special permissions\")\n```\n\n### NOT - Reverses True/False\n```python\nif not is_dead:\n    print(\"Player is still alive\")\n```\n\n## Combining Multiple Conditions\n\n```python\nif (level >= 10 and has_sword) or is_admin:\n    print(\"Access granted!\")\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a dungeon entrance checker:\n1. Set player level, has_key (True/False), current_health\n2. Check if player can enter (need key AND level >= 5)\n3. Check if they should heal first (health < 50)\n4. Print appropriate messages",
