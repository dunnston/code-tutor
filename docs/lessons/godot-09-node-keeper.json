  "description": "# The Node Keeper: Godot's Scene System\n\nWelcome to a unique lesson about Godot's most important concept: **Nodes and the Scene Tree**!\n\n## What are Nodes?\n\nIn Godot, everything is a **Node**. Nodes are building blocks that you combine to create games:\n\n- **Sprite2D**: Displays images\n- **CharacterBody2D**: A character that can move\n- **Area2D**: Detects collisions\n- **Timer**: Counts down time\n- **Label**: Shows text on screen\n\n## The Scene Tree\n\nNodes are organized in a tree structure:\n\n```\nPlayer (CharacterBody2D)\n├─ Sprite2D (shows player image)\n├─ CollisionShape2D (player hitbox)\n└─ HealthBar (ProgressBar)\n```\n\n## Accessing Nodes from Code\n\nUse `$` to access child nodes:\n\n```gdscript\n# Get a child node named \"Sprite2D\"\nvar sprite = $Sprite2D\n\n# Change its properties\nsprite.visible = false  # Hide the sprite\n```\n\n## Using get_node()\n\nAlternatively, use `get_node()`:\n\n```gdscript\nvar sprite = get_node(\"Sprite2D\")\n```\n\n## Common Node Operations\n\n**Hide/show nodes:**\n```gdscript\n$Sprite2D.hide()\n$Sprite2D.show()\n```\n\n**Change position:**\n```gdscript\n$Player.position = Vector2(100, 200)\n```\n\n**Queue free (delete):**\n```gdscript\n$Enemy.queue_free()  # Remove from scene\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nLearn to work with nodes through code:\n\n1. Print a message showing you understand nodes\n2. Create a dictionary representing a node's properties\n3. Simulate accessing and modifying node properties",
  "starterCode": "# Understanding Nodes lesson\n\n# Simulate a player node's properties\nvar player_node = {\n    \"name\": \"Player\",\n    \"position_x\": 0,\n    \"position_y\": 0,\n    \"health\": 100,\n    \"visible\": true\n}\n\n# Print the node name\n\n# Move the player (change position)\n\n# Take damage (reduce health)\n\n# Hide the player (set visible to false)\n\n# Print final state\n\n",
