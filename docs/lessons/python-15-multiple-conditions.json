  "description": "# More Than Two Choices\n\nSometimes you need to check multiple conditions, not just two. That's where **elif** (else-if) comes in!\n\n## The elif Statement\n\n```python\ndifficulty = \"medium\"\n\nif difficulty == \"easy\":\n    enemy_health = 50\nelif difficulty == \"medium\":\n    enemy_health = 100\nelif difficulty == \"hard\":\n    enemy_health = 200\nelse:\n    enemy_health = 100  # default\n\nprint(f\"Enemy health: {enemy_health}\")\n```\n\nPython checks each condition in order and runs the FIRST one that's True. The else is optional and runs if none match.\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a difficulty selector for your RPG:\n1. Ask the user to choose a difficulty (easy/medium/hard)\n2. Set different enemy stats based on their choice:\n   - Easy: 50 HP, 5 damage\n   - Medium: 100 HP, 15 damage\n   - Hard: 200 HP, 30 damage\n3. Print the enemy's stats\n4. Add a default case for invalid input",
