  "description": "# The Conditional Path: Making Decisions\n\nWelcome back, adventurer! Your journey continues to a fork in the road where you must make choices.\n\nIn programming, we often need code to make decisions:\n- If the player has enough gold, buy the sword\n- If health is below 20, show a warning\n- If the door is locked, ask for a key\n\n## The If Statement\n\nThe `if` statement checks a condition and runs code only if it's True:\n\n```python\nhealth = 15\n\nif health < 20:\n    print(\"Warning: Low health!\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- `if` starts the condition check\n- `health < 20` is the condition (is health less than 20?)\n- The `:` colon means \"here comes the code to run\"\n- **The indented line** runs only if the condition is True\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\nUse these to compare values:\n- `<` less than\n- `>` greater than\n- `<=` less than or equal\n- `>=` greater than or equal\n- `==` equal to (two equals signs!)\n- `!=` not equal to\n\n## The Else Statement\n\nUse `else` to handle what happens when the condition is False:\n\n```python\ngold = 100\n\nif gold >= 50:\n    print(\"You can afford the sword!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough gold yet.\")\n```\n\n## Indentation is Magic!\n\n⚠️ **Important:** Python uses indentation (spaces) to know which code belongs to the if/else.\n\nPress `Tab` or use 4 spaces to indent:\n\n```python\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")      # This runs if True\n    print(\"Welcome!\")   # This also runs if True\nprint(\"Done\")           # This ALWAYS runs (not indented)\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nYou encounter a magical door that requires a password.\n\n1. Create a variable called `password` with the value `\"dragon\"`\n2. Create a variable called `user_input` with the value `\"dragon\"`\n3. Write an if statement:\n   - If `user_input == password`, print: `\"Access granted!\"`\n   - Otherwise (else), print: `\"Access denied!\"`\n\n**Test both paths:** Try changing `user_input` to something else to see the else branch!",
  "starterCode": "# Create your variables\npassword = \"dragon\"\nuser_input = \"dragon\"\n\n# Write your if/else statement below\n\n",
  "solutionCode": "# Create your variables\npassword = \"dragon\"\nuser_input = \"dragon\"\n\n# Write your if/else statement below\nif user_input == password:\n    print(\"Access granted!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Access denied!\")",
  "hints": [
    "Use two equals signs to check equality: user_input == password",
    "Don't forget the colon : at the end of if and else lines",
    "Indent the print statements (press Tab before the print)",
    "The if and else should NOT be indented, but the prints inside them should be",
    "Make sure you use == (comparison) not = (assignment)"
