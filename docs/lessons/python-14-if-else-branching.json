  "description": "# Making Choices with Else\n\nYou've learned if statements, but what happens when the condition is False? That's where **else** comes in!\n\n## If/Else Structure\n\nThe else block runs when the if condition is False:\n\n```python\ngold = 30\nitem_cost = 50\n\nif gold >= item_cost:\n    print(\"Purchase successful!\")\n    gold = gold - item_cost\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough gold!\")\n```\n\nOne of these blocks will ALWAYS run - either if or else.\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\nPython supports many comparison operators:\n\n```python\n==  # Equal to\n!=  # Not equal to\n>   # Greater than\n<   # Less than\n>=  # Greater than or equal to\n<=  # Less than or equal to\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a merchant system that checks if a player can afford an item:\n1. Set player's gold amount\n2. Set item cost\n3. Use if/else to check if player has enough gold\n4. If yes: Print success message and show remaining gold\n5. If no: Print how much more gold is needed",
