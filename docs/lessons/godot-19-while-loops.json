Health: \", health)\n    health -= 20\nprint(\"Game Over!\")\n```\n\n## While vs For\n\n**For Loop:** Use when you know how many times to repeat\n**While Loop:** Use when you repeat until something happens\n\n## Be Careful!\n\n⚠️ Make sure the condition eventually becomes false, or you'll get an infinite loop!\n\n```gdscript\n# INFINITE LOOP - BAD!\nvar x = 0\nwhile x < 10:\n    print(x)  # x never changes!\n\n# GOOD - x changes\nvar x = 0\nwhile x < 10:\n    print(x)\n    x += 1  # Now it will end!\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate game systems using while loops.",
