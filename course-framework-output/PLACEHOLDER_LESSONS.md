## How to Create These Lessons

When creating placeholder lessons, follow the Python Fundamentals template:

1. **Copy structure** from existing Python lessons
2. **Adapt syntax** for the target language
3. **Match theme** - keep the RPG/game theme consistent
4. **Progressive difficulty** - start simple, build up
5. **Clear objectives** - what will students learn?
6. **Proper validation** - test cases that actually work
7. **Helpful hints** - progressive, not too obvious

### Example Workflow

1. Pick a lesson concept (e.g., "while-loops")
2. Look at Python equivalent for structure
3. Translate to target language syntax
4. Adjust examples for language idioms
5. Create appropriate validation tests
6. Write 5 progressive hints
7. Test the lesson yourself

## Priority Order

1. **Next**: JavaScript lessons 6-30 (most requested for web development)
2. **Then**: C# lessons 6-30 (Unity game development)
3. **Finally**: GDScript lessons 6-25 (Godot game development)

## Notes

- Each language has its own personality in lesson themes
- Python = Fantasy/Magic theme
- GDScript = Game development theme
- JavaScript = Web/DOM theme
- C# = Enterprise/Unity theme

- Keep starter code helpful but not too complete
- Validation should be strict but fair
- XP rewards scale with difficulty and time
- Final projects should be comprehensive but achievable
