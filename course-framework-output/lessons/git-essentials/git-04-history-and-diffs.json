  "description": "# Exploring Your Project History\n\nOne of Git's superpowers is the ability to see everything that happened in your project. Who changed what? When? Why?\n\n## The `git log` Command\n\nThe `git log` command shows you the commit history:\n\n```bash\ngit log\n```\n\nThis displays:\n- Commit ID (a unique hash like `a3f2c1d...`)\n- Author name and email\n- Date and time\n- Commit message\n\n### Useful `git log` Options\n\n```bash\n# Compact one-line view\ngit log --oneline\n\n# Show last 5 commits\ngit log -5\n\n# Show commits with file changes\ngit log --stat\n\n# Visual graph of branches\ngit log --graph --oneline\n```\n\n## The `git diff` Command\n\nWant to see exactly what changed? Use `git diff`:\n\n```bash\n# See unstaged changes\ngit diff\n\n# See staged changes\ngit diff --staged\n\n# Compare two commits\ngit diff commit1 commit2\n```\n\n### Reading Diff Output\n\n```diff\n- This line was removed (red)\n+ This line was added (green)\n  This line stayed the same\n```\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Make some changes to a file\necho \"Hello Git!\" > greeting.txt\n\n# See what changed (before staging)\ngit diff\n\n# Stage the changes\ngit add greeting.txt\n\n# See staged changes\ngit diff --staged\n\n# Commit\ngit commit -m \"Add greeting file\"\n\n# View commit history\ngit log --oneline\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nWrite commands to:\n\n1. View the commit history in a compact format (one line per commit)\n2. See the differences in staged files\n\nPut each command on its own line.",
