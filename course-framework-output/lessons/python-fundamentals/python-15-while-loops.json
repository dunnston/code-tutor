  "description": "# The While Loop Chamber\n\nYou've discovered an ancient chamber that repeats its trials until you succeed. This is the essence of the while loop - repeating actions as long as a condition remains true!\n\n## While Loops\n\nUnlike for loops that iterate a specific number of times, while loops continue as long as a condition is True:\n\n```python\nhealth = 3\n\nwhile health > 0:\n    print(f\"Health: {health}\")\n    health -= 1  # Decrease health\n\nprint(\"Game over!\")\n```\n\n**Warning**: Always ensure the condition eventually becomes False, or you'll create an infinite loop!\n\n## Your Quest\n\nYou're gathering resources until you have enough:\n\n1. Create a variable `resources` = 0\n2. Create a variable `needed` = 5\n3. Use a while loop that runs while `resources < needed`\n4. Inside the loop:\n   - Add 1 to resources\n   - Print \"Gathered resource. Total: \" followed by the resources count\n5. After the loop, print \"Quest complete!\"\n\nExpected output:\n```\nGathered resource. Total: 1\nGathered resource. Total: 2\nGathered resource. Total: 3\nGathered resource. Total: 4\nGathered resource. Total: 5\nQuest complete!\n```",
  "starterCode": "# Starting resources and goal\nresources = 0\nneeded = 5\n\n# Gather resources until you have enough\n\n\n# Quest complete message\n\n",
  "solutionCode": "# Starting resources and goal\nresources = 0\nneeded = 5\n\n# Gather resources until you have enough\nwhile resources < needed:\n    resources += 1\n    print(\"Gathered resource. Total: \" + str(resources))\n\n# Quest complete message\nprint(\"Quest complete!\")",
  "hints": [
    "The while loop condition should be: resources < needed",
    "Inside the loop, increment resources: resources += 1",
    "Print the message with the current resources count",
    "The loop will run 5 times (until resources reaches 5)",
    "Don't forget to print 'Quest complete!' after the loop ends"
