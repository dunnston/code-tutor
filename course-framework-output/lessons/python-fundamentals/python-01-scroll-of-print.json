  "description": "# Welcome to Fantasy Quest!\n\nYou've discovered an ancient scroll that contains the most fundamental spell in all of programming: **the print spell**.\n\nThis spell allows you to display messages to the console - a magical window where your code speaks to you.\n\n## The Print Spell\n\nIn Python, the print spell looks like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, adventurer!\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- `print` is the spell name\n- The parentheses `()` hold the message you want to display\n- The quotation marks `\"\"` tell Python this is text (called a **string**)\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCast the print spell to display the message:\n\n**Welcome to Fantasy Quest!**\n\nThen, on a new line, cast another print spell to display:\n\n**I am ready to learn coding!**",
