  "description": "# The Two-Path Choice\n\nYou stand at a crossroads. The path ahead splits in two. Your choices will determine your fate. This is the power of if-else branching!\n\n## If-Else Statements\n\nWhen you need to handle both outcomes:\n\n```python\nhealth = 75\n\nif health > 50:\n    print(\"You are healthy!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You need healing!\")\n```\n\nThe `else` clause provides an alternative when the condition is False.\n\n## Your Quest\n\nA merchant offers you a magical item, but only if you have enough gold.\n\n1. Create a variable `gold` = 150\n2. Create a variable `item_cost` = 100\n3. Use if-else to check if `gold >= item_cost`\n4. If yes: print \"You purchased the enchanted sword!\"\n5. If no: print \"Not enough gold!\"\n\n**Note**: Since you have 150 gold and the item costs 100, you should be able to buy it!",
  "starterCode": "# Your current gold\ngold = 150\nitem_cost = 100\n\n# Check if you can afford the item\n\n",
  "solutionCode": "# Your current gold\ngold = 150\nitem_cost = 100\n\n# Check if you can afford the item\nif gold >= item_cost:\n    print(\"You purchased the enchanted sword!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough gold!\")",

    "Use >= to check if gold is greater than or equal to item_cost",
