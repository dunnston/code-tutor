  "description": "# Writing to Scrolls\n\nYou've learned to read scrolls (files), now learn to write them! Saving data lets your programs persist information between runs.\n\n## Writing Files\n\nUse `open()` with 'w' mode (write) or 'a' mode (append):\n\n```python\n# Write mode (overwrites existing file)\nwith open('quest_log.txt', 'w') as file:\n    file.write(\"Quest 1: Defeat the dragon\\n\")\n    file.write(\"Quest 2: Find the artifact\\n\")\n```\n\n## Append Mode\n\n```python\n# Append mode (adds to end)\nwith open('quest_log.txt', 'a') as file:\n    file.write(\"Quest 3: Return home\\n\")\n```\n\n## Important!\n\n- 'w' mode **overwrites** the entire file\n- 'a' mode **adds to the end**\n- Always use `with` to automatically close files\n- Remember to add `\\n` for new lines\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a save game file:\n\n1. Create a list: `stats = [\"Player: Hero\", \"Level: 5\", \"Gold: 150\"]`\n2. Open 'save_game.txt' in write mode\n3. Write each stat on a new line (use a for loop)\n4. Then open the same file in read mode\n5. Print all lines to verify they were saved\n\nExpected output:\n```\nPlayer: Hero\nLevel: 5\nGold: 150\n```",
  "starterCode": "# Player stats to save\nstats = [\"Player: Hero\", \"Level: 5\", \"Gold: 150\"]\n\n# Write stats to file\n\n\n# Read and verify the file\n\n",
  "solutionCode": "# Player stats to save\nstats = [\"Player: Hero\", \"Level: 5\", \"Gold: 150\"]\n\n# Write stats to file\nwith open('save_game.txt', 'w') as file:\n    for stat in stats:\n        file.write(stat + \"\\n\")\n\n# Read and verify the file\nwith open('save_game.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print(line.strip())",
