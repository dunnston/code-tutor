  "description": "# Nested Loop Patterns\n\nYou've discovered that loops can contain other loops - this is called nesting! Nested loops are powerful for working with grids, combinations, and multi-dimensional data.\n\n## Nested Loops\n\nA loop inside another loop:\n\n```python\nfor row in range(3):\n    for col in range(3):\n        print(f\"Position ({row}, {col})\")\n```\n\nThe inner loop completes ALL its iterations for EACH iteration of the outer loop.\n\n## Creating Patterns\n\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        print(\"*\", end=\" \")  # Print in same line\n    print()  # New line after each row\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\nCreate a dungeon map grid:\n\n1. Use a nested loop: outer loop for rows (0 to 2), inner loop for cols (0 to 2)\n2. For each position, print \"[X]\" (represents a dungeon room)\n3. Use `end=\" \"` in print to stay on the same line\n4. After each row (inner loop completes), print an empty line\n\nExpected output:\n```\n[X] [X] [X]\n[X] [X] [X]\n[X] [X] [X]\n```",

    "Use range(3) for both the outer and inner loops",
    "Print '[X]' with end=' ' to stay on the same line",
    "After the inner loop completes, print() with no arguments creates a new line",
    "The outer loop runs 3 times, and the inner loop runs 3 times for each outer iteration (9 total rooms)",
    "Structure: for row in range(3): then for col in range(3):"
