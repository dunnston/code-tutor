  "description": "# The Ancient Archives\n\nAs a keeper of knowledge, you must learn to read and write scrolls (files) to preserve information across your adventures!\n\n## Writing to Files\n\nTo write to a file, use the `open()` function with mode `'w'` (write):\n\n```python\nwith open('quest_log.txt', 'w') as file:\n    file.write('Day 1: Started my adventure\\n')\n    file.write('Day 2: Found a magic sword\\n')\n```\n\n**Important:**\n- The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed\n- Mode `'w'` creates a new file or **overwrites** an existing one\n- Use `\\n` to create new lines\n\n## Reading from Files\n\nTo read a file, use mode `'r'` (read):\n\n```python\nwith open('quest_log.txt', 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\n```\n\n## Reading Line by Line\n\n```python\nwith open('quest_log.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes extra whitespace\n```\n\n## Your Quest\n\n1. Write a file called `'hero_story.txt'` with three lines:\n   - `\"Chapter 1: The Beginning\"`\n   - `\"Our hero starts their journey\"`\n   - `\"The quest awaits!\"`\n2. Read the file and print its contents\n3. Count and print the number of lines in the file\n\n**Note:** For this lesson, the code will simulate file operations. In a real environment, files would be created on your computer!",
